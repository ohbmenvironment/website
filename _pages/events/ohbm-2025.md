Are you joining for OHBM 2025 in Brisbane, Australia?

See below for our calendar of conference events.

**OHBM Annual Meeting 2025**

The **Sustainability and Environmental Action** Special Interest Group (SEA-SIG) will have a symposium at Brisbane 2025, “[Silicon vs Carbon: Balancing scientific aspirations with environmental costs](https://ww6.aievolution.com/hbm2501/Events/viewEv?style=1&ev=2610)”. This will include talks on:
- How to study the impact of climate change, looking specifically at mental health
- How to reduce the carbon footprint of our research, looking at MRI and AI
- How to push organizations towards sustainability, with an example from the healthcare sector in Australia

We also jointly organized an Educational course with the Open Science SIG called “Maximizing scientific efficiency through sustainability, reproducibility, and FAIRness“. You can find the program [here](https://ww6.aievolution.com/hbm2501/Events/viewEv?ev=2237).
