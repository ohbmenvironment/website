The Sustainability and Environmental Action group was formed by the Organisation for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM) in 2020 in recognition of the need to reduce the impact that the organisation and its members have on the environment.

To achieve this overall aim, the group works with the neuroimaging community to develop tools and educational materials that help researchers be aware of their environmental impact and make changes to minimise this. This includes working directly with OHBM to advise on how the annual conference can be made more sustainable.

The group aims to be a supportive forum where people within the neuroimaging community and beyond can work together to help preserve our planet for the future.
