Preserving our planet is a collective need so we believe that community-based action is an important part of any solution.

The group holds regular community meetings where everyone can contribute to decide what actions should take priority. Carrying out these actions is then the responsibility of community-based working groups that are open to all.

The 2020 Community Meeting identified the following three areas as priorities:
- [Annual meeting group](/working-groups/annual-meeting)
- [Neuroimaging research pipelines group](/working-groups/green-computing)
- [Education and Outreach group](/working-groups/education-and-outreach)
