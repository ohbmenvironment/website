title: Annual meeting working group
---

Chair: Polona Kalc

The purpose of this group is to look at how the OHBM conference is organised and advise the OHBM Council as to how its environmental impact can be reduced.

Topics to be worked on include:
- Assessing the environmental impact of the annual meeting and producing annual reports to monitor changes in this. The carbon footprints for the 2017, 2018 and 2019 meetings were calculated in [this paper](https://apertureneuro.org/article/87678.pdf).

- Investigating options for more sustainable conference models for future OHBM meetings and investigating (un)sustainable conference centre practises, and how these can be addressed

- Collaboration with the [Education & Outreach](/working-groups/education-and-outreach) Working Group on educational activities during the annual meeting (symposia, socials, and special events). Check the [OHBM Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@OHBM/videos) for past symposia.
