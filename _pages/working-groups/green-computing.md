Chair: Nick Souter

Neuroimaging research often relies on compute-intensive data processing and analysis in order to study brain structure and function. In order to process and analyse data, computers require energy, which in turn has a carbon footprint. Storing and working with large datasets can also place demands on energy, by requiring regular backups and because novel servers may need to be manufactured and transported. The size of this footprint can be substantial when relying on high-performance computing (HPC). Our work in this area so far has focused on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, other imaging modalities, including MEG, EEG, and PET, frequently also require energy intensive computing – in future we hope to also focus attention on these modalities.

The overall objective of this subgroup is to contribute towards efforts for zero-carbon data processing and storage. This will involve making use of low carbon energy sources, and shifting toward environmentally sustainable computing cluster infrastructure. However, making this change will also rely on changes in user behaviour. That’s why our current work focuses largely on better understanding how the environmental impacts of research computing can be measured and reduced. Specific aims include:
- Empirically measuring and comparing the carbon footprint of neuroimaging analysis tools, such as FSL, SPM, and fMRIPrep
- Striving to create and promote green computing tools, including carbon trackers and climate-aware task schedulers
- Providing education on the impact of computing on the climate crisis, within and beyond neuroimaging research, through workshops, tutorials, and presentations
- Generating general recommendations for green computing in neuroimaging research
- Considering and discussing the overlaps and tensions between environmental sustainability and open science practices, such as data sharing and preregistration

SEA-SIG has a [separate site hosted on GitHub](https://neuropipelines.github.io/index), with specific examples of our work (Updates coming soon!).

**Green computing tools**

See our [green computing tools page](/working-groups/green-computing-tools) for a list of tools that can be used to measure or reduce the carbon footprint of your computing, including some developed by SEA-SIG members.
