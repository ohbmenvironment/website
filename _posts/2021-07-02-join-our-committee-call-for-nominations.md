We are moving into our second year and are looking for people to take key roles on the SIG organising committee. 

Getting involved is a great way to make a major difference within the OHBM community and to the world we share. 

Three positions are open for nominations:
- Chair
- Treasurer
- Secretary

Each position requires a time commitment of around one hour per week across the year (a lot of which is around the annual meeting).

You are welcome to nominate yourself and prior experience within the SIG is not necessary!

Each of these positions is for a three year period. The first year is a training period, followed by a year in the main position, and finally a year in an advisory capacity. 

The nomination period is between the 2nd and the 23rd of July. Nominations can be made by email to ohbm.sea.sig@gmail.com. 

We welcome any inquiries there too! The current Chair, Secretary or Treasurer will be very happy to chat with you about what the role involves.

Early career researchers, people from under-represented groups, and people outside Europe and North America are encouraged to apply.
