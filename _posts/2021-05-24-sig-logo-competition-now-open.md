title: "SIG logo competition now open!"
---

We’re calling all artists and designers to help visualize a logo concept for our recently founded OHBM Sustainability and Environment Action (SEA) Special Interest Group. We created a placeholder logo upon our founding last year (see our website), which was closely based on the main OHBM logo. However, the time is now right to create a dedicated SIG logo. If you’d like to create a logo for consideration, please review the details on the BrainArt blog.
