The Sustainability and Environmental Action Special Interest Group is opening its call for for the committee election!  

There are **three positions** open for nominations:
- Chair
- Secretary
- Treasurer

You are welcome to nominate yourself and prior experience within the SIG is not necessary.

You are eligible to become a Committee member if:
- You are a current member of OHBM (student members included);
- If you have previously held a position on the Committee, at least one year must have passed since the end of your term; 
- You are in good standing with the SIG, as determined by the acting SIG officers. Examples of reasons whereby a candidate may be deemed to be in poor standing are if they have been found to have violated the code of conduct on one or more occasions at SIG or OHBM-related events, or if they have an explicit conflict of interest. 

Each of these positions is for a **three-year period**. The first year is a training period, followed by a year in the main position, and finally a year in an advisory capacity. 

The nomination period is between the **15th of August and the 15th of September 2024. Nominations can be made by email to ohbm.sea.sig@gmail.com**. Please include a short statement of about 200 words covering why you are applying for the role, and why you would make an effective member of the Committee.

We welcome any inquiries to ohbm.sea.sig@gmail.com too! The current Chair, Secretary, or Treasurer will be very happy to chat with you about what the role involves.

Early career researchers, people from under-represented groups, and people outside Europe and North America are encouraged to apply.
