To create a new post, make a copy of this file and rename it following this format: `YYYY-MM-DD-my-great-title.md`.
Note that the `my-great-title` part must be unique.

Then update the front matter (block at the top of this file) to have a new title and the current date.

Set the categories and tags as appropriate.
If the category is "news", the post will be visible in the "Latest news" section at the bottom of the homepage and on the "News" page (accessible through the top navigation bar).
If the category is "events", the post will be visible on the "Events" page (accessible through the top navigation bar).
